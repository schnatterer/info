<p>
    In the last 10 years I've worked in a variety of roles in development, operations and technical leadership.
</p>
<p>
    In the early years I developed mainly in Java and JavaScript.<br/>
    In the last couple of years I came to do more operations, which coincided with the rise of containers and cloud-native.<br/>

<p>
    In general, I'm a strong believer in <a href="{{ site.projects_url }}">open source</a>,
    like to <a href="{{ site.publications_url }}">write</a> and would love do much more
