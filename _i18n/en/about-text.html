<p>Throughout the past three decades, I was active in different fields of IT.</p>
<p>Having grown up in software development, I work different domains and roles such as developer, architect
    <a href="https://cloudogu.com/en/trainings/">trainer</a>, technical project management and leadership.
</p>

<p>With the advent of container technology, DevOps gradually became my focus.</p>
<p>I'm a <a href="{{ site.projects_url }}">contributor to many open source projects</a>,
    publish <a href="{{ site.publications_url }}">articles, posts and books</a> regularly and love speaking
    at <a href="{{ site.talks_url }}">conferences</a>.
</p>
<p>As technical Lead of the infra and consulting teams at Cloudogu, my daily work is about the Cloud,
    DevOps, GitOps and Kubernetes, among other things.</p>
<p>In this role, I helped to establish modern ops processes in small and large organizations.</p>
<p>My current focus are our internal Kubernetes and GitOps-based developer platform, as well as development of the
    <a href="https://github.com/cloudogu/gitops-playground">GitOps Playground</a>.</p>

<p>Since 2021, I'm on the program advisory board of the <a href="https://www.mastering-gitops.de/">Mastering GitOps</a> conference.</p>
<br/>

<p>I'm also available as an <a href="#consulting">independent consultant</a>.</p>
