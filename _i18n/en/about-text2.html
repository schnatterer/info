<p>In recent years, I have helped build modern cloud operations for small and large organizations.
    <br/>This often involves Kubernetes and GitOps-based operations platforms (Internal Developer Platforms, IDPs).
    <br/>In 2020, at Cloudogu, we therefore started developing the open source 
    <a href="https://github.com/cloudogu/gitops-playground">GitOps Playground</a> to deploy and operate standardized IDPs in an
    automated way.</p>
<p>Since 2021, I have been a member of the program committee of the <a href="https://www.mastering-gitops.de/">Mastering
    GitOps</a>
    conference.</p>
<p>In 2024, I co-authored the book <a href="https://gitops-book.dev/">GitOps</a>.</p>

<p>I am a longtime <a href="{{ site.projects_url }}">open source contributor</a>, <a href="{{ site.publications_url }}">author</a> 
    and <a href="{{ site.talks_url }}">speaker</a>.</p>
