            <p>
              In the last 10 years I've worked in a variety of roles in development, operations and technical leadership. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In the early years I developed mainly in Java and JavaScript.<br/>
              In the last couple of years I came to do more operations, which coincided with the rise of containers and cloud-native.<br/> 
            </p>
            <p>
                In general, I'm a strong believer in <a href="{{ site.projects_url }}">open source</a>,
                like to <a href="{{ site.publications_url }}">write</a> and would love do much more
                <a href="{{ site.talks_url }}">talks</a>.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                I work for <a href="https://cloudogu.com/">cloudogu</a>, where I lead the infra team, that 
                provides a Kubernetes and GitOps-based platform to our application teams, that develop 
                <a href="https://my.cloudogu.com/">myCloudogu</a>, the <a href="https://cloudogu.com/en/ecosystem/">Cloudogu ecosystem</a> 
                and <a href="https://scm-manager.org/">SCM-Manager</a>, among other things.<br/>
                I'm also senior <a href="https://cloudogu.com/en/consulting/">consultant</a> and <a href="https://cloudogu.com/en/trainings/">trainer</a>
                for Kubernetes, Docker and GitOps.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before that I was one of the lead developers of <a href="https://my.cloudogu.com/">myCloudogu</a>, an 
                <a href="https://scm-manager.org/">SCM-Manager</a> maintainer and consultant in different industries 
                like automotive, logistics, finance, insurance, health and aerospace.
                There, I worked in different roles, as (lead) developer, architect, technical project manager, 
                requirements engineer and in quality assurance.
