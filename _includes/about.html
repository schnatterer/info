            <p>
              In the last 10 years I've worked in a variety of roles in IT, ranging from QA, developer, technical lead & 
              DevOps.
              <br/>
              In the early years I developed mainly in Java and JavaScript, with a slight preference towards backend topics.
              I'm better with databases than with CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the last couple of years I came to do more operations, DevOps or AppOps.
              <br/> 
              This coincided with the rise of containers and cloud-native. I became so enthusiastic about all things 
              cloud-native that I started conducting trainings in the Kubernetes and Docker space.

                I work for <a href="https://cloudogu.com/">cloudogu</a>, where I'm one of the lead developers of <a href="https://my.cloudogu.com/">my.cloudogu.com</a> and a senior trainer.
